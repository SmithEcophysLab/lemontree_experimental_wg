## c4 curve fitting (Zinny)
- medlyn approach
	- based on von caemmemerer (2000)
- fit some good curves!
- some with high Vcmax
- some with no Jmax
	- Nick: this is by design and is okay
- some things to check
	- checking Km values
	- looking across the entire curve with plots
	- check temperatures and any temperature response/standardization
- overall the curves look good with good RMSE's
