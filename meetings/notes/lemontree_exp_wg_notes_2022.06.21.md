## updates
### Jan
- taking photosynthesis
- natural soil doing worst
- sterilized and high fertilizer doing best
- Paul: pathogenic effect? cluster roots or variation?
  - Jan: how do we test this?
      - Paul: grow in different soils
- Evan: microbes hoarding the limited N? immobilization?
  - still not sure how to discern this from other effects
  - root staining? can this be done with stored samples?
- photosynthesis tends to match visual biomass

### evan
- started CO2 experiment on Friday
- everything going well, but no germination yet
- separated into 2 iterations (1000 and 420 ppm)

### zinny
- C3/C4 acclimation experiment planning
- still trying to find seeds

### Paul
- C3/C4 experiment > doing it iteratively
- 2nd try now (failure first time)
- weekly drought to half seedlings
- has some A/Ci, respiration, and fluorescence measurements
- harvested plants for AG biomass
- will do BG and morphology this week
- 2nd batch has gone through one cycle
- fitting A/Ci curves an issue?
  - should figure out what options will work best for us
  - talk with Jeff?
- dark respiration

### brad
- collect leaves at RMBL for Astrid
  - morphology and 13C at RMBL
  - same leaf or one close by
    - get both to be safe
    - could take punches for chemistry

### Hugo
- cloud roots project
  - meteorological timescales
  - measuring canopy profiles at tall EC tower in Amazon
  - could align work with LEMONTREE
  - stay close to EC tower
