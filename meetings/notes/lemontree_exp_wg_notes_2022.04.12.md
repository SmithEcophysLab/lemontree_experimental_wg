## april 12, 2022

## Jan experiment update
- started germination
- 100 similar sized individuals
- solanum and grasses
- talked with Evan about nutrient solutions
- getting soils tomorrow
	- gamma sterilized and unsterilized
	- will transplant germinants soon (1-1.5 week)
	- germination done on sterilized soils
- taking soil samples throughout for C:N
	- maybe P?
- soil
	- pure sand and nutrient-poor natural soil
		- latter has active microbiome
		- 84% sand in the field soil
	- might be better for root washing to use lots of sand??

## Phosphorus method
- mass destruction method
	- dangerous preparation
- picoflux >> laser-based method
	- current machine is mis-calibrated
	- get all other elements
	- x-ray fluorescence

## Astrid update
- california herbaria
- 5-7 leaves from "every" sample

	- stomata, C:N:P, and isotopes
- waiting for samples
- 1500 m elevation
- time goes back to late 1800s
- pine and oak
- 11 samples >> 5 at low elevation and 6 at higher
	- 11 per species (22 total)
	- same species, but not same tree

- still figuring out time frame
- Paul has started germination for C3/C4 experiment
	- under water stress
	- end of July to end October

## Evan update
- waiting on growth chambers for his experiments
- pure sand?
	- main issue is keeping the pots hydrated
	- need dishes underneath
	- need to add rooting cloth underneath
