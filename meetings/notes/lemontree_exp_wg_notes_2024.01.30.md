# lemontree experimental wg meeting notes
## jan 30, 2024

- australia field work
	- all goals met
	- no problems
	- open to collaborations
	- daniil, paul and catherine joined
	- aci and light curves
	- two weeks, nine days in field
	- measurements in the mornings only
	- 10 km gradient from ocean to inland
		- more N limited near coast and P limited further inland
	- aci curves, spectral properties and lai
	- 9 total sites, 10 aci curves per site
	- additional porometer measurements
	- collected leaf material and did sla, will also do chemistry
	- extremely happy with how it went
	- fluorescence measurements as well (li-600)
	- multispectral data with ASD
	- very different species in the different sites
	- high diversity further inland
	- leaf temperature measured with porometer (li-600)
	- hard to control leaf temperatures in the field
	- picked species only based on leaf size (picked things with big enough leaves)
	- older sites famous for cluster roots

- jan/astrid update
	- jan soil nutrient/microbiome experiment
		- nutrient treatments make sense from theory
		- microbiome results a little odd still (natural soils reducing plant performance
		as compared to the sterilized soils)
		- nick notes: interaction b/w treatments, 15n suggesting different n pools w/ microbiome?
			- did not do interaction
			- 15n would tell if there are different pools that the plants are pulling from
	- astrid, theoretical paper on temporal constraints for EEO modeling
		- combine other existing theories with P-model
		- literature review on type of response and the time scale of adjustment (cool figure)
		- ci and chi respond on different time scales
		- cool figures showing responses to different conditions over different timescales
