## august 29, 2023

## updates
### takeaways from lEMONTREE meeting
- involve Tsinghua and Reading
- a and b quantification
- quantum efficiency is important
- within canopy measurements are useful

## alissar
- project 1: nutnet
	- data from multiple nutnet sites
	- hypotheses about Nmass responses to soil N under different climates
	- climate is more important for Nmass than soil N addition
	- change in Nmass is greater in cold, dry, high radiation climates
	- change in Nmass is not related to change in AGB
	- questions
		- drought as driver of Nmass (not in model now)
		- what is most important climate driver? drought
		- what is explaining rest of variability?
- project 2: n acquisition strategies from observational data
	- combined 6 datasets of leaf carbon isotope data
	- calculated chi and beta
	- hypotheses about how variables should differ between mycorrhizal types and across
	different nutrient availability gradients
	- AM and non-Nfixers have highest N costs (highest beta)
	- humid sites: patterns normal except for ECM-AM
		- switching to different uptake type?
	- humid: N effects as expected
	- semi-arid: P patterns not as expected
	- semi-arid: N effects inverse of what is expected
	- arid: P effects not consistent
	- arid: N effects ... notetaker missed this (check slides)
	- global model (humid): expectations maintained
	- questions
		- point map not entirely correct
		- crossing over of ECM and AM cost points
			- experiment to do this?
- project 3: drought by n experiment
	- 2 N levels crossed with 3 water treatments
	- weekly morphology
	- daily transpiration
	- gas exchange + chemistry at 4 time points
	- destructive measurements at end
	- vcmax
		- high N: reduction under slow drought, but not fast drought
		- low N: reduction under both droughts
		- not sure how change is linked to leaf N and chi
	- jmax same as vcmax
	- questions
		- what is sample size? 8 per treatment
		- quantifying a and b? yes, will be done
		- aci curves on drought plant, do you rewater? under water stress condition
		- why not higher Vcmax under drought?
			- maybe the issue is with mesophyll conductance
		- same species that buckley used for model
			- looking at stomatal on top/bottom

## nitrogen wg paper
- will talk more friday

## quantum efficiency measurements
- logistics of leaf T response curves
- how to get leaf T gradient?
	- water jacket on 6400
	- measurements in a cold room
- paul's experiment
	- 2 temperature regimes with 2 species
		- swap them
		- paul starting in jan/feb
- garry's experiment
	- starting soon...send paul the protocol once we settle on something
