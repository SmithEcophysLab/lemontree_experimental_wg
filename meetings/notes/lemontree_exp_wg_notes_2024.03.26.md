# lemontree experimental working group meeting notes
## march 26, 2024

- pre-meeting notes
	- alissar and jan experiment idea update
	- eve can update progress, but no data analyzed yet

- meeting notes
	- not everyone here to start because of time change (nick's mistake)
	- jan had meeting with colin, shirley, hugo
		- NxP and fungixCO2 experiments are in need
	- fungal staining/measuring
		- snehanjana has a method that works
		- jan's similar method didn't seem to work
	- alissar/jan experiment
		- dual symbiosis experiment with species that harbor AMF and N2-fixing bacteria
		- using pernnial and annual Medicago species
		- test how optimality theory can elucidate cost-benefit tradeoffs of
		different symbionts under different conditions
		- previous studies
			- synergistic effects of AMF and Nfix on growth in perennials, but
			additive in annuals
				- annual invest less in symbionts and have more direct uptake
			- no control on soil nutrient levels
		- *experimental design*
			- AMF (2 levels) x Nfix (2 levels) x P (2 levels) x N (2 levels)
		- *hypotheses*
			- synergism in growth, photosynthesis, nutrient uptake when both N and P are limiting
		- *outstanding questions*
			- how to measure phosphorus uptake from different pools?
				- labeled P
				- comparison between groups
					- seems to be best solution based on design and questions
				- split pots
			- what will light levels be?
				- high!
					- make demand high so you have a treatment where supply does not meet demand
