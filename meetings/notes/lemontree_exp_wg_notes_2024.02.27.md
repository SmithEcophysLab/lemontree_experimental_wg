# lemontree experimental working group notes
## feb 27, 2024

- email from shirley to jan
	- wants meeting between carbon allocation and CNP working group
	- try for march 14?
	- no direct question, but looking for data
- lemontree august meeting and ecr summer school
	- hugo trying to postpone for when all pi's can make it
- zinny growth chamber presentation
	- **expected c3 response to co2 needs fixed**
	- **need to also fix temperature treatment (low temp is 25C)**
	- reduction in photosynthetic capacity with CO2 for C3
	- increases in photosynthetic capacity with warming for C3
	- reducions in photosynthetic capacity with warming for C4
	- not changes with CO2 for C4
- alissar fieldwork plans
	- visiting gradient in TX across precip, nutrient(?), and AM/ECM 
		- question is about carbon allocation across these gradients
	- hypothesis: c allocation to myco decreases with increasing soil nitrogen
	- looking at relative difference between mining (ECM) and scavenging (AM) strategy
	- AM strategy better for water acquisition
		- *interesting idea*
		- means ECM don't help with water?
	- getting Vcmax from leaf N >> *a little tricky*
	- ctranfer to myco/soil = gpp - biomass - autotrophic respiration
	- soil samples for myco measurements
	- soil samples for soil texture
	- karin questions
		- belowground data for communities or individual plants?
			- try for individual plant samples
		- will work if differences are clear
			- do you expect clear differences?
				- big difference in meta-analysis (global), but what about at this smaller
				scale?
		- soil moisture from remote sensing
	- am vs ecm water acquisition
	- follow-up controlled experiment planned
		- these will be preliminary experiment
