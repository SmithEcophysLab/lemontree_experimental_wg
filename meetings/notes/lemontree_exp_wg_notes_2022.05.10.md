# meeting notes
## may 10, 2022

## updates
- alex, new BS student at UU
	- literature survey of gsmax from anatomy vs. gas exchange
	- looking at operational gs (not optimal!)
	- dataset with 130 species of combined measurements
	- range is 0.06 to 0.6 (average is ~0.3)
	- main driver (from literature) is tradeoff of not having too many stomata versus not too far open
		- too far open you lose control
	- how would this compare to optimal?
	- peter franks: evolutionary advantage to match optimal and anatomical maximum
	- what happens if conditions change much faster than evolution can keep up with
	- present work at this time??
		- maybe, maybe not
- albert pit, undergrad at UU
	- continuing working on phylogeny work
- jan
	- transplanted seedlings to treatment pots
	- taken a few for C:N
	- nutrient treatments starting this week
		- used the ones they already had prepared
	- some algal growth on trial pots
		- might add nutrients from above and water from below, but this would increase algal growth
	- Hugo: trying to fight algae may cause more problems
		- suggest keep watering from the top to make sure nutrients get in
- evan, jan, paul, dorian meeting last week
	- came up with spreadsheet to compare nutrient treatments
	- good to make things comparable
- TTU
	- herbarium samples from GUMO
		- share with Astrid??
		- Nick checked gradient: about 2000 m
			- see some data here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nlP5Xkyq_jIibKVTeDtWXfQmxqhWiJWRNCZu0on5IoA/edit#slide=id.ge3e5731643_0_41
		- could we measure operational gsmax with GUMO data?
	- rapid ACi curve
		- Evan optimizing protocol
		- will share with greater group
		- can send paper with method
- Thursday talks
	- streamline talks between the 2 groups
	- try to include the audience as much as possible
	- Evan: will share N by inoculation experiment
		- focus on teeing up ongoing/new experiments
	- general question: what data do you all need?
		- experiments as well as looking through the literature
	- mention that we'd like to do more collaborating with the modelers
		- can they model our experiments??
	- also mention Paul's group in Perth
- maximum conductance
	- anatomical versus maximal from gas exchange
- EGU
	- Jan and Astrid will be there Thursday - Friday
- next meeting will be in 4 weeks (break for EGU)
