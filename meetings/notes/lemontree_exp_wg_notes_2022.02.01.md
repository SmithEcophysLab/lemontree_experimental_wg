# lemontree experimental wg meeting notes
## Feb 2, 2022

- jan introduction
	- past work
		- functional-structural plant models
		- root investment and nitrogen deficiency
		- is allocation based on allometric growth principle?
		- maize in hydroponics with 5 levels of nitrogen
		- calculated expected with different N amounts
		- separated by leaf, stem, roots (and root parts - whorls, primary, and seminal roots)
		- every plant performed better than expected across all treatments
		- fit with expolinear growth response
		- root growth response was similar across treatments
		- root to leaf DW decreased with increasing N treatment
		- decrease in SRL with N treatment
			- only signal of root system plasticity
	- next work
		- WUE/NUE tradeoffs
			- factorial CO2 x P and CO2 x N experiments
		- microbial symbionts
			- factorial soil x nutrient experiment
			- Dorian testing methods for symbionts
	- questions
		- connection to lemontree goals related to biomass allocation
		- can we use hydroponics
			- jan: it is possible, but differences: obstruction of root growth when they
			reach the bottom of the pots, pH changes may have impact
			- jan: decrease in pH over the course of the experiment due to higher NH4 uptake
			- used altered Hoaglands solution for other nutrients
				- had to add iron buffer for deficiency
			- not great for symbionts (Dorian)
			- Hugo: could change nutrient availability quickly! --> testing timescale
			- functional equilibrium held, without fixed allocation

- next meetings
	- evan next week on eco2 experiment
	- next week: experimental protocols
		- align approaches
	- p-model discussion/introduction --> kick off next week's discussion
	- protocols and facilities in 4 weeks
		- Agricultural FACE facility (Hugo)
