## meeting notes
- daniil introduction
	- junior assistant professor (teaching and doing PhD)
	- going to australia for fieldwork
	- plant strategies and adaptation to N and P limitation
- australia trip
	- still waiting on visa
- eve presentation
	- switched things up a bit >> focusing on light with soybean
	- focusing on LUE
	- different morphological and physiological responses to light availability
	- upregulation will take longer than downregulation
	- new leaves will acclimate morphology, while old leaves won't
	- morphology acclimation will be faster
		- actually "more complete"
	- methods
		- 32 plants
		- low light (450 PAR) and high light (1200) setup
		- previously developed and newly developed leaves
		- 4 treatments with 8 replicates
		- many measurements
			- both physiology and morphology measurements
	- questions
		- humidity
			- go lower based on Evan's past measurements (30% instead of 70%) 
		- hugo had masters student do similar experiment
			- but had an iron supplement
				- make sure to have sufficient micronutrients
			- eve to read thesis
		- when will they be moved?
		- lots of ACi curves (correct!)
		- talk with Astrid about anatomical stomatal traits
			- will need to take diurnal measurements
				- nick: this is too much
		- astrid: leaf age is hard to account for
			- things may change with age
		- light quality
			- we can change this in chamber
			- adjust this to the spectra (%'s) that the licor uses
- meetings next year
	- update on australia field campaign
	- astrid/jan paper update
	- alissar results/paper plans
	- zinny results to share
	- eve results to share
	- jan/sneha experiment idea
	- summer fieldwork plans
